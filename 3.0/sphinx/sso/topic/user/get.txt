Getting details of users
========================

An already logged user can get details of his or her account only. It is not possible for regular users to look up information
about other users. However, :doc:`super-users <./super>` may read details of any other person by the other user's ID.

This chapter presents examples in a goal-oriented manner - consult
:doc:`REST <../../api/rest/user/get>`
and
:doc:`Python <../../api/python/user/get>`
API docs for all details.

Get user details - regular users
--------------------------------

Invoke *GET /zato/sso/user* to query for user details by current UST (user session token). If the calling user is a regular one,
not a super-super, it is the only way for that user to look up his or her own account.

Note that it does not matter if UST is provided in query string or JSON body.
