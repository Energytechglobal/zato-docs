Hot-deployment from an IDE
--------------------------

Since release 3.0, Zato supports a special endpoint that allows you to deploy
Python modules loaded in one of several supported Integrated Development
Environments directly to a Zato cluster, enabling must faster develop/test
cycles when prototyping new services.


Supported Environments
======================

Visual Studio Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Zato for Visual Studio Code plug-in <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zatosource.ide-vs-code>`_
available from the Visual Studio marketplace adds a default keybinding along
with a toolbar button enabling one-click deployment to your development
cluster.

Please visit the extensions gallery in Visual Studio code (by pressing
ctrl-shift-X) and search for "zato" for further instructions on how to install
this plug-in.


PyCharm

The `XXX for YYY plug-in <https://www.google.com/`_ available from ZZZ adds

Zato 3.x Configuration
======================

In a newly installed Zato 3.x cluster, the IDE deployment service and channel
are preconfigured and associated with an RBAC role. A default HTTP Basic Auth
credential, ``ide_publisher``, is created with a randomly assigned password
and assigned to the RBAC role.

In order to make use of IDE deployment in Zato 3.0, it is only necessary to
reset the password for this default account. If you prefer, you may create a
new Basic Auth credential and assocate it with the **IDE Publishers** RBAC
role instead.

To reset the ``ide_publisher`` password, first visit the **Security -> HTTP
Basic Auth** section of the administration UI for your cluster:

Select the **Change password** option for the pre-installed ``ide_publisher``
credential:

Set the password to something meaningful, and choose **OK**.
