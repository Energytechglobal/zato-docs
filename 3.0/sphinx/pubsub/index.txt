Publish/subscribe topics and guaranteed delivery queues
=======================================================

Overview

Publish/subscribe lets one design integrated environments using an event-based architecture of producers publishing
business messages to topics and subscribers receiving the messages independently of any other.

While in transit, messages are kept in queues that may exist in RAM or in persistent storage. The latter forms the basis
of Guaranteed Delivery - a feature which enables delivery of messages even if faced with server restarts or
unavailability of intended recipients.

Zato provides queues, routing, security, APIs and GUI administration facilities - applications connect using REST, SOAP
or WebSockets. It is also possible to listen for filesystem events and publish files to topics.
