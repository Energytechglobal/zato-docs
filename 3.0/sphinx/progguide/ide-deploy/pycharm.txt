PyCharm
-------

To enable hot-deployment from PyCharm, ensure you have first followed the
configuration instructions in :doc:`index`.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As our plugin is published in the [JetBrains Plugin
Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10375-zato-hot-deployment),
installation on PyCharm is achieved by visiting **Preferences -> Plugins**,
then clicking **Browse repositories**:

Next, search for **Zato** and click the **Install** button:

Once installation completes, visit **Preferences -> Languages & Frameworks ->
Zato** to populate connection information for your development cluster:

Finally, with a service module open in the editor, visit **Tools -> Upload to
default Zato server** to trigger upload:

Alternatively, automatic deployment can be triggered on every file save, by
including the magic `ide-deploy=True` marker comment somewhere in the file:

Success is indicated in the status bar at the bottom of the window:
