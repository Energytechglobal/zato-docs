Visual Studio Code
------------------

To enable hot-deployment from Visual Studio Code, ensure you have first
followed the configuration instructions in :doc:`index`.

The `Zato for Visual Studio Code plug-in <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zatosource.ide-vs-code>`_
available from the Visual Studio marketplace adds a default keybinding along
with a toolbar button enabling one-click deployment to your development
cluster.

Please visit the extensions gallery in Visual Studio code (by pressing
ctrl-shift-X) and search for "zato" for further instructions on how to install
this plug-in.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With Visual Studio Code, visit the Extensions Marketplace either
[in your browser](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zatosource.ide-vscode),
or within the application by pressing *Ctrl+Shift+X* hot-key:

After installation completes, a quick visit to the settings panel
(Ctrl+,) is needed to configure your cluster connection:

While editing any Python script, you can deploy to the configured Zato cluster
with a simple icon click, by pressing the *Ctrl+Shift+L* hotkey:

Just as in PyCharm, automatic deployment can also be triggered on file save, by
including the magic `ide-deploy=True` marker comment somewhere in the file:

Success is indicated through a status panel that appears following activation:

For more information, please refer to the setup instructions provided in the
extension's README.md, which is presented as part of the Marketplace user
interface embedded within Visual Studio Code.
