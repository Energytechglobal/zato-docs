WebSocket connections
=====================

WebSocket channels created in :doc:`web-admin <../web-admin/channels/wsx>` are programming language-agnostic, which means that
they may be used to invoke services and publish or receive :doc:`publish/subscribe <../pubsub/index>` messages
from any application that speaks WebSockets and JSON, e.g. Python, JavaScript or any other.

To utilize the channels, applications (API clients) need to follow a protocol described in this chapter.

* Upon opening an initial TCP stream, the client needs to obtain a token within a certain time (by default, 5 seconds)
* Token returned by Zato identifies uniquely this particular client connection down to its TCP socket
* The token is a random string considered a secret and must not be shared with any other client or connection
* No other client is allowed to re-use an already issued token and each connection has exactly one token throughout its existence
* Although the token is a strong random string, it can be used only for client identification and it must not be
  used on client side for any cryptographical purposes (there are dedicated :doc:`crypto <./crypto/index>` APIs in Zato
  for such needs)
* Each token has a TTL, a Time To Live, which defaults to 864000 seconds = 10 days. Each time the channel is invoked the token's
  TTL is extended by that many seconds from current time. If token reaches its TTL, any subsequent invocation will be rejected
  and the TCP socket will be closed.
* Clients must send WebSocket Ping frames (per `RFC-6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.2>`_) at least
  once in 30 seconds. If 5 consecutive pings from a client are missed, the connection is dropped by Zato.
* Ping frames must not send business data, they are used only to keeping connections alive
* Applications may both invoke API services as as well take part in :doc:`publish/subscribe <../pubsub/index>`
  workflows - in the latter case they can act as publishers, subscribers, or both
