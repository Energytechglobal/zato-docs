Sessions
========

Sessions represent users that are logged in to the system. Each session may have a number of
arbitrary :doc:`attributes <sso-session-attr>` associated that are stored in the database for as long as the session exists.
There is no limit to how many sessions a single user may have active at a time.

More information:

* How to :doc:`log a user in <./login>`
* How to :doc:`log a user out <./logout>`
* How to :doc:`access existing sessions <./read>`
* How to use :doc:`session attributes <./attrs>`
