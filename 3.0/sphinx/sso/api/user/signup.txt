Sign-up process
===============

This chapter explains how users may interact with APIs to sign themselves up with the system.

Information is presented in a task-oriented manner - consult the :doc:`reference chapter <./ref>` for full API documentation and
:doc:`CLI chapter </../../cli/sso>` for command-line interface.

Workflow
---------

A flexible process is offered for users to sign up with the system which will in turn validate their credentials and
optionally let super-users accept or reject new accounts.

Note that this functionality can be turned off completely in :doc:`configuration <../config/index>` if it's not desired to let
users open their own accounts.

Sign-up
~~~~~~~

If user sign-up is enabled and users sign up themselves, their accounts will be created and, depending on configuration:

* Super-admins will need to accept them
* No acceptation will be necessary

In either case, users may be required to confirm their signup by triggering an API call with a confirmation token - typically
sent in email, which Zato can also do. The token is returned in response to the signup call.

::

  $ curl -XPOST localhost:11223/zato/sso/user/signup -d '
    {
      "username": "my-user1",
      "password": "VrF57-H31 7!HIj%fSAz :L9",
      "email":    "myuser1@example.com",
      "app_list": ["CRM"]
    }
  '

  {
    "confirm_token": "zcnt8538ba1f6bef475a8fee1fc8cee65dac"
  }

Default validation rules of new users are:

* Keywords 'zato', 'admin' and 'root' cannot be used anywhere in username
* Password may not be among the most commonly used ones in the world
* Both username and email must be unique
* All of the checks above are performed case-insensitively
* Additionally, ASCII whitespace cannot be used in username and email, but is accepted in passwords

All validation rules may be
:doc:`re-configured or implemented <../config/index>`
in a different manner, according to an environment's specific needs.

Note that users will likely not know code names of applications they sign up to (CRM in the example below).
This needs to be provided on input by the calling API client, e.g. a frontend, and all names of applications
must be configured beforehand in :doc:`sso.conf <sso.conf>`.

Sign-up confirmation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If sign-up confirmation is required, users will receive a token, usually to their email inbox, that needs to be sent
to Zato in a REST call as below:

::

  $ curl -XPOST localhost:11223/zato/sso/user/signup/confirm -d '
    {
      "confirm_token": "zcnt8538ba1f6bef475a8fee1fc8cee65dac"
    }
  '

At this point user will be confirmed but it may be still possible that a super-user will need to approve the account's creation,
depending on configuration.

If approval is not required, the user can :doc:`log in <../session/index>` already and use their
account accordingly.

Getting a list of users for approval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An already logged-in super-admin sends a GET request to fetch the list of new signups to approve or reject. Note that the 'ust'
parameter is user session token obtained when a user, including a super-user, :doc:`logs in <../session/index>`.

It is possible to send GET parameters in query string, body, or the mix of the two, there is no difference. This applies to all
Zato endpoints.

::

  $ curl -XGET "localhost:11223/zato/sso/user/signup?status=to-approve&ust=zust1a799f0a..."

::

  $ curl -XGET localhost:11223/zato/sso/user/signup -d '
    {
      "status": "to-confirm",
      "ust":    "zust1a799f00d3a147f088bb83bdfe76761c",
    }
  '

In all cases, a JSON list is returned with basic data about users that can be approved or rejected, or an empty list
if there are no pending users.

::

  [
    {
     "user_id":           "zusrqgh3au1pt4b7r5rz",
     "username":          "myuser1",
     "email":             "myuser1@example.com",
     "display_name":      "John Doe",
     "sign_up_time":      "2018-02-13T15:32:24", # Always in UTC
     "remote_ip":         "10.23.91.177",
     "remote_addr":       "mysystem.company"
    }
  ]

Approving users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Super-admins approve the creation of a user account as below. There is no JSON output.

::

  $ curl -XPOST localhost:11223/zato/sso/user/signup/approve -d '
    {
      "user_id": "zusrqgh3au1pt4b7r5rz"
    }
  '

Afterwards, the new user may :doc:`log in <../session/index>`.

If configuration requires it, an email with a welcome message may be sent to the newly approved user now.


Rejecting users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Super-admins reject a new user account as below. There is no JSON output.

::

  $ curl -XPOST localhost:11223/zato/api/user/signup/reject -d '
    {
      "user_id": "zusrqgh3au1pt4b7r5rz",
      "reason": "Information for user why this account has been rejected",
    }
  '

If told to by configuration, an email with a reason for the rejection will be sent to user.

A rejected user account is deleted from the database and if the same user wants to sign up again, the person needs to start anew.

Zato services API
-----------------

All of the features available through REST are also accessible through Zato services API, as below:


.. highlight:: python
   :linenothreshold: 0

::

  from zato.server.service import Service

  class MyUserService(Service):
      """ A demo service for user management.
      """
      def handle(self):
          pass
