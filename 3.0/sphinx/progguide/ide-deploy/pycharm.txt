PyCharm
-------

To enable hot-deployment from PyCharm, ensure you have first followed the
configuration instructions in :doc:`index`.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the Zato IDE hot-deployment plugin is published in the `JetBrains Plugin
Repository <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10375-zato-hot-deployment>`_,
installation on PyCharm is achieved directly from within the application.

1. Visit **Preferences -> Plugins**, then click **Browse repositories**:

3. Once installation completes, visit **Preferences -> Languages & Frameworks ->
   Zato** to populate connection information for your development cluster:

Activation
~~~~~~~~~~

With a Zato service open in an editor window, visit **Tools -> Upload to
default Zato server** to trigger upload:

Automatic Activation

Automatic deployment can also be triggered on every file save, by including a
special ``ide-deploy=True`` marker comment somewhere in the file:
