Configuring SSO
===============

All of SSO configuration takes place through config files or :doc:`command line interface <../../admin/cli/sso>`.
This chapter covers the config files.

There are two files involved:

* server.conf
* sso.conf

File server.conf is used only to enable or disable SSO functionality as a whole whereas sso.conf deals with details of
how SSO should work once enabled.

The files belong to Zato servers and they don't exist with other components, e.g. a Zato web-admin or scheduler
do not have them.

Both of the files can be found in the *config/repo* sub-directory of a server.

For instance, if a path to server is /opt/zato/env/server1 then the files with be in:

* /opt/zato/env/server1/config/repo/server.conf
* /opt/zato/env/server1/config/repo/sso.conf
