Visual Studio Code
------------------

To enable hot-deployment from Visual Studio Code, ensure you have first
followed the configuration instructions in :doc:`index`.

For additional notes, please refer to the extension's README.md which is
presented as part of the Marketplace user interface embedded within Visual
Studio Code.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Zato for Visual Studio Code plug-in <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zatosource.ide-vscode>`_
available from the Visual Studio marketplace adds a default keybinding along
with a toolbar button enabling simplified hot-deployment to your development
cluster.

1. Visit the Extensions Marketplace either `in your browser <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zatosource.ide-vscode>`_, or within the application, by pressing *Ctrl+Shift+X* hot-key:

Activation
~~~~~~~~~~

While editing any Python script, you can deploy to the configured Zato cluster
by clicking the toolbar icon, or pressing the *Ctrl+Shift+L* hotkey:
