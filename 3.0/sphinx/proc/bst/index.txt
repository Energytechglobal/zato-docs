Business state transitions
==========================

Business states transitions (BST) are a feature of Zato allowing users to efficiently design, monitor and visualize
states that business objects go through in integration processes backed by Zato services or external and independent systems.

Managing orders, customer cases and any other workflow-oriented tasks are perfect use-cases for BST.

BST definitions are processed by Zato's state machine controlling and enforcing correct transitions for each instance
of a flow of objects.

Definitions can be versioned and a given business object can take part in multiple BSTs, including multiple versions of the same definition.

Users create definitions in plain English or any other natural language, as below:

::

    Orders
    ------

    Objects: Order, Priority order
    New: Submitted
    Submitted: Ready
    Ready: Sent
    Sent: Confirmed, Rejected
    Rejected: Updated
    Updated: Ready
    Force stop: Canceled, Timed out

Full REST API allows to integrate into BST third-party tools and applications written in Java, .NET,
JavaScript, PHP or any other technology.
