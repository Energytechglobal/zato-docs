User management
===============

This chapter explains what user objects are and they can be created, updated and deleted from REST and Zato services.

Information is presented in a task-oriented manner - consult the :doc:`reference chapter <./ref>` for full API documentation and
:doc:`CLI chapter </../../cli/sso>` for command-line interface.

User objects
------------

* Users represent people accessing applications on whose behalf Zato provides security mechanisms
* Users may have access to one or more application
* Users may be regular ones or super-users - the difference is that super-users can carry out a set of admin operations from APIs
  or command line against any other user (e.g. lock an account) while regular users cannot
* Users may send sign up requests to open an account
* Users may invite other users to open an account

All of the broader parts of the functionality can be turned on or off as needed, for instance, it is possible to disable
the ability for users to sign up themselves. Read the :doc:`configuration chapter <../config/index>` for details.

The basic attributes of users are:

* username
* password
* email
* display_name, or
* first_name, middle_name and last_name

Depending on needs, either display_name or first/middle/last name can be used - the very notion of first and other names
may possibly not exist in a user's culture, hence Zato does not enforce their existence.

Additional attributes:

* app_list
* attrs

In the context of SSO (Single-Sign On), users may have access to one or more applications - app_list describes
to what a given user may log in or otherwise interact with.

Moreover, it is possible to attach an arbitrary set of key/value attributes to each user - they can be used to
extend information about users to cover supplementary needs, such as timezone, phone number or street address.

Creating users
---------------

Only super-users may create other users
